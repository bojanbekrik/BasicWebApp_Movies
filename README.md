# BasicWebApp_Movies
This is a simple web application, where I have implemented the options to add, edit and delete movies. 
I have also connected this web app with a database. Tools that I used for creating this web app were Spring Boot (Java-based framework), HTML and Bootstrap. 
Furthemore I utilized MySQL Workbench for database management and development in my project.
